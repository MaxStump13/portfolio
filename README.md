## Description
I was tasked with creating a personal portfolio to demonstrate personal projects to future employers. The goal was to make a webpage that is visually appealing with access to projects I have completed using HTML and CSS, specifically FlexBox. Utilizing flexbox, I was able to create a structured webpage that is both desktop and mobile friendly. I was able to include images with links embedded in them to my projects. I structured my HTML with semantic elements and alt tags for more accessibility. During the creation of my portfolio, I learned how to nest flexboxes effectively using containers. I also learned how to customize images in CSS more, and I gained a better understanding of padding, margins, and borders on elements.

## Usage
Here is the deployed link to my portfolio. [My portfolio](https://maxstump13.github.io/portfolio/) Below is what the site looks like on screens larger than 768px and screens smaller than 768px. If one of the headers in the navigation is clicked, a scroll animation to that section is triggered. If the Resume header is clicked, another tab is opened to a resume. In the Work section, the images are blurred until hovered over. If one of the projects is clicked, a new tab is opened with that project. At the bottom, my contact information and profiles are listed with active links.
